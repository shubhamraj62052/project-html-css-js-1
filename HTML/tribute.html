    <p>
      Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist
      and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
      2007.<br />He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
      physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
      scientist and science administrator,<br />
      mainly at the Defence Research and
      <a href="">Development Organisation (DRDO)</a>
      <a href="">and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</a> and was
      intimately involved in India's civilian <br />space programme and
      military <a href="">missile development efforts.</a>[1] He thus came to
      be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
      ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4]. He also
      played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
      India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
      <a href=""> original nuclear test by India </a>in 1974.[5]

            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
            Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the
            Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press
            Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after
            becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service
            (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but
            remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam
            joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned
            space scientist

            Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
            family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar
            traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts
            of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal
            Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and
            local women. The family business had involved trading groceries
            between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as
            well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With
            the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however,
            the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were
            lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
            poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had
            to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.

            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931,
            to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on
            Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State
            of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner
            and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took
            Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
            uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
