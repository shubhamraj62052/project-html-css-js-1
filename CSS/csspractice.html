        this is the example of of internal css where we use css inside the head
        tag like if i want to add css in paragraph then we first decleared it in
        head inside p.it is same for all remaing elements like h1.
    <p style="background-color: rgb(211, 44, 74);color: cyan;">here we can also declear color specificliy to paragraph
        by using inline css property which is declearnig css inside the element which is p here.so the priority of
        <BR>inline is higher above internal css we can declear css by 3 ways one is inline another is internal and also
        external css.</p>
    </p>
    <p class="para">only the letter</p>
    <p class="para">which comes inside</p>
    <p class="para">the class para all those are different color as decleared in .para style</p>
    <p class="para" id="p12">here the class name is also declearedbut the id has more prefence over the class so this paragraph color is changed.</p>
